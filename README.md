# 📌 Final Recommendations (As a Manager)  
1. **Invest in Franchises**: Sequels and cinematic universes (MCU, Avatar, Star Wars) are proven to generate billion-dollar revenues.  
2. **Focus on International Markets**: Prioritize foreign distribution strategies—dubbing, cultural localization, and China/India-specific releases.  
3. **Balance Quality & Revenue**: High-rated genres (animation, historical, war) may not dominate revenue but build **brand prestige** and long-term loyalty.  
4. **Leverage OTT Platforms**: 2020 proved that high-rated films can succeed outside box offices; hybrid releases are a sustainable strategy.  
5. **Diversify Production Countries**: Co-productions with rising markets (India, China, Japan) can capture new audiences.
